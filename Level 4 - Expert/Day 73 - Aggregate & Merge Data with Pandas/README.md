# Day 73 Aggregate & Merge Data with Pandas

## Overview

For Day 73, we will be continuing to explore Pandas dataframes, Matplotlib and learning to aggregate and merge data.

### Setup

1. Install [Jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
2. Install [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

### Instructions

1. Challenge 1:
   1. Import the data from the `colors.csv` file into Pandas dataframe
   2. Get the count of all the unique colors in the data set
2. Challenge 2:
   1. Find the number of transparent colors using two different methods
3. Challenge 3 & 4:
   1. Use HTML to display the pictures in the notebook markdown
4. Challenge 5:
   1. Import the `sets.csv` file into a Pandas dataframe
   2. Get the first 5 rows
   3. Get the last 5 rows
5. Challenge 6:
   1. Find out which year the first Lego sets were released and the names
6. Challenge 7:
   1. Find how many different sets Lego released in the first year
   2. Find out how many types of products were offered in the year they started
7. Challenge 8:
   1. Find the top 5 Lego sets with the most parts
8. Challenge 9:
   1. Use `groupby()` and `count()` to show the number of sets Lego released each year
   2. Find how many sets were released in 1955
   3. Find how many sets were released in 2019
9. Challenge 10:
   1. Create a line chart to show the number of sets released each year
10. Challenge 11:
    1. Use `groupby()` and `agg()` functions to Find out how many themes were released per year
    2. i.e. Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc
11. Challenge 12:
    1. Plot the number of themes released each year on a line chart
    2. Plot a chart to include number of sets released and use the `twinx()` function
12. Challenge 13:
    1. Use `groupby(0` and `agg()` to find the average number of parts per set
    2. Find out how many parts were in the average Lego set released in 1954 compared to 2017
13. Challenge 14:
    1. Plot a scatter chart to show the average number of parts per set over time
14. Challenge 15:
    1. Use HTML to display the pictures in the notebook markdown
15. Challenge 16:
    1. Import the data from `themes.csv`
    2. Get the first 5 rows
    3. Get the last 5 rows
    4. Get the results for "Star Wars" in theme name
    5. Using the `sets.csv` data, search for some of the theme id's from the "Star Wars" results
16. Challenge 17:
    1. Create a dataframe with theme id's and set counts columns and call it "set_theme_count"
    2. Merge with the themes dataframe on `id`
    3. Create a bar chart with the merged data
    4. Clean up the graph using styling

### Comments

This project was also straightforward and exploring the basics of Pandas with Matplotlib for charting.
