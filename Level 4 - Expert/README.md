### Comments

August 30, 2022

    Due to time constraints and being a manager at my employer, I have been working extra hours to keep the store running. This left me with less time to focus on my projects recently.

    I am deciding that the best route for me will be to put days 77-80 on hold while I focus on the last leg of the 100 Days of Python Challenge.

    I believe it is in the best interest as I will be able to focus more attention to learning data analysis and the new Python libraries.
