# Day 72 Data Visualisation with Matplotlib

## Overview

For Day 72, we will be continuing to explore Pandas dataframes and moving into charting data with Matplotlib.

### Setup

1. Install [Jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
2. Install [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

### Instructions

1. Challenge 1:
   1. Import the data from the `QueryResults.csv` file into Pandas dataframe
   2. Get the first 5 rows
   3. Get the last 5 rows
2. Challenge 2:
   1. Check the dimensions of the dataframe
   2. Count the number of entries in each column
3. Challenge 3:
   1. Calculate the total number of posts per language
   2. Determine which has the highest number of posts of all time
   3. Determine how many months of data exists for each language
4. Clean the Data:
   1. Get the DATE into a readable format by removing the timestamp
5. Create a new dataframe using `pivot()` and name it `reshaped_df`
6. Challenge 4:
   1. Find the dimensions of the new dataframe
   2. Print the column names
   3. Get the first 5 rows
7. Challenge 5:
   1. Count the number of entries per programming language
   2. Replace `NaN` values with 0
   3. Get the first 5 rows to see the difference
8. Challenge 6:
   1. Using `Matplotlib` plot Java onto a chart
   2. Hint: Use index
   3. Create a larger figure using `figure()`
   4. Create another plot chart with Java and Python
9. Challenge 9:
   1. Plot all the languages into one chart
   2. Adjust the chart with `rolling()` and `mean()` and create:
       1. 6 observations chart
       2. 3 observations chart
       3. 12 observations chart

### Comments

This project was also straightforward and exploring the basics of Pandas with Matplotlib for charting.
