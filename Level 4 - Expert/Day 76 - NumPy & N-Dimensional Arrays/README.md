# Day 76 NumPy & N-Dimensional Arrays

## Overview

For Day 76, we will be working with NumPy.

### Setup

1. Install [Jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/)
2. Install [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

### Instructions

1. Challenge 1:
   1. Use `arange()` to create a vector `a` with values ranging from 10 to 29
   2. OUTPUT:
   ```[10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29]```
2. Challenge 2:
   1. Use Python slicing techniques on `a` to:
      1. Create an array containing only the last 3 values of `a`
      2. Create a subset with only the 4th, 5th, and 6th values
      3. Create a subset of `a` containing all the values except for the first 12 (i.e., [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29])
      4. Create a subset that only contains the even numbers
3. Challenge 3:
   1. Reverse the order of the values in `a`, so that the first element comes last
   2. OUTPUT:
   ```[29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10]```
4. Challenge 4:
   1. Print out all the indices of the non-zero elements in this array:
   ```[6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5, 0]```
5. Challenge 5:
   1. 
6. Challenge 6:
   1. 
7. Chalenge 7:

8. Challenge 8:
