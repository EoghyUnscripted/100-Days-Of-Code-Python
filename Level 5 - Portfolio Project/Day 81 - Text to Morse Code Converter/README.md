# Day 81 Text to Morse Code Converter

This project for Day 81 will be a simple, text-based core Python application that accepts and converts user input strings into Morse Code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [Python 3.9.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installing

- Follow the step-by-step guides to install Python 3.9.13
- Mac Users, use the Terminal to verify your current Python version
  - Update the version as necessary

## Deployment

Simply run the program using your favorite IDE or the CLI.

### Use Case

The application will allow users to enter in strings as input to be convertes to Morse Code, which will be displayed on-screen. Users will be given the opportunity to enter new strings or exit the program when completed.

### Future Use Cases

In addition to the basic function of the app, I plan to expand the functionality to allow users to upload text files for conversion and output to either the screen or a new conversion file.
