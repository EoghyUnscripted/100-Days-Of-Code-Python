#### Comments

June 6, 2022

    As someone that already knows HTML and CSS, I combined Days 41-44 together and completed the course work in one main project to build a simple resume/CV page. This did not include any Python during the course content for these days, but I did not want to skip anything as this would be contrary to the challenge.

    Due to not having time off of work this week, I took this day to rest a bit as the API key for the day's project required some time to generate.
