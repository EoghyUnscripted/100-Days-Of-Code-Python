# Day 56 Rendering HTML & Static Files

## Overview

For this project we will be creating a Flask app that builds a name card.

## Project: Name Card

With this project, we will create a new Flask app that uses static files and an HTML template to build a digital name card similar to a business card.

### Setup

1. Install [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)

### Instructions

1. Download a free template from [HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net)
   1. Create a static folder and add the downloaded `assets` and `images` folders into the directory
2. Create a `server.py` file
   1. Create a new Flask app and use the `render_template` from the Flask module to direct to the `index.html` file
3. In the `index.html` file:
   1. Change the directory paths to direct to the static files
   2. Modify the template fillers with your information

> **_NOTE:_** The image files may render as gradients per the distribution license. These can be changed to your own photos.
