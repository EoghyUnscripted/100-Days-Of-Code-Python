# Day 58 Bootstrap

## Overview

For Day 58, we will be working with Bootstrap to design a website.

## Project: Tindog

For this project we will be learning how to work with Bootstrap to create a webpage for a fake app similar to Tinder.

### Setup

1. Install [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
2. Get a kit link from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)

### Instructions

> **_NOTE:_** As there are way too many instruction steps to type, these are high-level instructions.

1. Title section:
   1. Add a navbar with "tindog" and add links to contact, pricing, and download
   2. Use bootstrap grid system to split the content to the left and right on larger screens
   3. Rotate the image on larger screens to fill
   4. Style the download buttons with fontawesome icons
2. Feature Section:
   1. Evenly space the content in a row on larger screens
   2. Add fontawesome icons to each feature item
3. Testimonials Section:
   1. Add a carousel for testimonial items with buttons
   2. Combine the press section items into testimonials with the same background
      1. Evenly space the logos and size dynamically
4. Pricing Section:
   1. Model the section using [Bootstrap Pricing Example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/pricing/)
5. CTA (call to action) Section:
   1. Style the download buttons with fontawesome icons
6. Footer Section:
   1. Add fontawesome icons for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Email
7. Style the page with CSS fonts and Bootstrap classes to match the provided color scheme
8. Add `@media` selectors to the CSS file

### Comments

This project was extremely long. I already know how to work with Bootstrap but the requirements were not clear upfront. I skipped most the content to get the requirements and built from there.

I added some extra's into the mix such as href links to sections on the page.

#### Forking

Be sure to add your fontawesom kit link into the `index.html` file in the head section or the icons will not work.
