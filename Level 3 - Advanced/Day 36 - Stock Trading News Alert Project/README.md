# Day 36 Stock Trading News Alert Project

## Overview

For Day 36, we will build off what we learned for the Rain Alert project in day 35 to create a Stock Alerts project.

### Comments

For this project, I chose to omit the `Headline` label. I also removed the brief and replaced it with the url that comes with the data so that you can open and view the article itself. The headline provided enough information that adding the brief seemed redundant as it repeated the headline for the most part.

#### Forking

If you chose to fork this app, please be sure to update the variables in `stock_alerts.py` with your own data. I recommend setting them as environment variables while your code is open to the public.

For example:

```python
import os

api = os.environ['API_KEY']
```

To set your environment variables, open the `terminal` in your editor and navigate to your environment directory. Create each of your variables using the format below:

```sh
export API_KEY="enterYourStringHere"
```

#### Additional Resources
