# Day 41-44 CV Project

## Overview

For Days 41-44, we did not work on Python. These days were dedicated to introductory HTML and CSS to create a personal CV page. As someone that knows HTML and CSS, I chose to combine the days into one main project.

## Project: Personal CV

For this project, we will be using HTML and CSS to create a basic CV (Resume) page that can be hosted online.

### Instructions

1. Develop a personal CV/Resume using only HTML
   1. Include a professional photo
   2. Personal Content or Accomplishments
   3. Work Experience
   4. Hobbies
   5. Links
   6. Contact Form
2. Enhance the personal CV/Resume using CSS styling
   1. Select a color theme for styling
      1. Headers
      2. Background
      3. Text
      4. Horizontal rule
   2. Modify fonts
   3. Modify `<hr/>` tags
      1. Change size
      2. Change border style
   4. Add a favicon
   5. Implement DIVs
   6. Apply element positioning for aesthetic
   7. Make additional style changes as desired

### Output Examples

- [Thomas H. Cormen - Bio](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/) - Used as the primary resource for creating our own CV during the course
  - [Angela Bauer CV](https://angelabauer.github.io/cv/) - Plain CV/Resume output using strictly HTML based on Thomas H. Comen's page
- [Se√°n Halpin - Interactive Resume](https://web.archive.org/web/20180819202235js_/http://seanhalpin.io/) - Reference site for CSS styling

### Comments

For this project, I focused on mimicking the course instructor for the page, but made some modifications in styling and theme.

There are two folders:

- HTML CV - Strictly using HTML
- Enhanced CV - Using HTML and CSS Styling
