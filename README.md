# 100 Days of Code - Python

> I chose to take on this challenge to push myself even further with my programming skills in Python. While I do fairly well with the language and have had previous exposude, I know I can alwasys learn more. Even in the first few days of the challenge, I have learned new ways of performing certain tasks. These new ways of performing the same tasks teaches me better ways of coding, and shorter ways!
>
> My goal with taking on this challenge is to become more fluent in the Python programming language. My first language was Java when I was in college, but I eventually outgrew it when I started to learn Python and how much more flexible it is as a language. All languages have pros and cons, but Python seems to address more of the cons and has evolved into an incredibly useful language in the business world.
>
> As a developer, I am still going to focus my time and energy across all of the programming skills I possess. However, I know it is important for the professional world to be fluent in at least one language and skilled in many. Ultimately, I hope this challenge helps prepare me in my goal of becoming a professional software engineer. Here's to 100 days of progress!
