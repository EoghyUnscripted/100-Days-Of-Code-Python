# 100 Days of Code - Python

> I chose to take on this challenge to push myself even further with my programming skills in Python. While I do fairly well with the language and have had previous exposude, I know I can alwasys learn more. Even in the first few days of the challenge, I have learned new ways of performing certain tasks. These new ways of performing the same tasks teaches me better ways of coding, and shorter ways!
>
> My goal with taking on this challenge is to become more fluent in the Python programming language. My first language was Java when I was in college, but I eventually outgrew it when I started to learn Python and how much more flexible it is as a language. All languages have pros and cons, but Python seems to address more of the cons and has evolved into an incredibly useful language in the business world.
>
> As a developer, I am still going to focus my time and energy across all of the programming skills I possess. However, I know it is important for the professional world to be fluent in at least one language and skilled in many. Ultimately, I hope this challenge helps prepare me in my goal of becoming a professional software engineer. Here's to 100 days of progress!

## Note

The purpose of these courses is to utilize what was learned in previous lectures as you progress each day. You may look at the source codes and think about how it could be done in a better way than what is posted. Most likely, I will be thinking the same thing as I am not a beginner in Python. Once I have finished with the 100 days of Code challenge, I am expecting to revisit some projects and enhance them into fully fleshed out programs.
