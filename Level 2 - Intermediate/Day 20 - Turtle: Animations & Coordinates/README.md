# Day 20 Turtle: Animations & Coordinates

## Project: Snake Game Part 1

Using the Turtle package, we will build a snake game. This will include the object shape, collision detection, user key listeners and a scoreboard.

### Instructions

1. Create a snake body
2. Create a function to constantly move the snake forward
3. Allow user key input to change direction of snake:
   1. North (90 Degrees) = `Up`
   2. South (270 Degrees) = `Down`
   3. East (0 Degrees) = `Right`
   4. West (180) = `Left`
