    Now that life has settled down more for me and income flow back on track, I am finally able to really
    get back on track. I had setbacks with finances that prevented me from continuing my Udemy subscription
    which hosts my 100 Days of Code course.

    Today, I will start with Day 22 and continue to move forward with my training.

    Due to starting a new job, training, and working 60 hours a week, my progress during the challenge
    was put on pause. Now that my schedule is back to standard 40 hours, I will be able to continue
    working toward completing the challenge. 
    
    Even with the setbacks, completing this challenge is important to me, and I will continue driving
    my efforts to do so. I want to be able to look back and be proud of this accomplishment.
