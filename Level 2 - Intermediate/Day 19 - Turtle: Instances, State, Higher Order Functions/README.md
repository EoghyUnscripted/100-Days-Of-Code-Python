# Day 19 Turtle: Instances, State, Higher Order Functions

## Overview

Day 19 starts with learning how to work with functions in python libraries for key press inputs.

      Exercise 19.1 - Create an Etch-A-Sketch app using key inputs to move the turtle object

## Project 2: Turtle Racing

Using the Turtle package, we will build an app that lets a user pick a color and races against other turtles using randomisation to move each turtle across the screen. The first to reach the end is declared the winner.

### Instructions

1. Extract the colors from `image.jpg` using colorgram
2. With these colors, recreate a `10 x 10` image with dots
   1. Each dot should be a random color from the extracted list
   2. Each dot should be spaced `50` paces apart
   3. Each dot should be `20` in size
3. Start from the bottom left to right and move up the rows
4. There should be `100` dots in total
