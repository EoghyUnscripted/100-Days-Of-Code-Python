# Day 21 Turtle: Inheritance & List Slicing

## Project: Turtle Racing

Using the Turtle package, we will continue part 2 to build a snake game. This will include the object shape, collision detection, user key listeners and a scoreboard.

### Instructions

1. Create `snake food`
2. Create a `scoreboard` object to track the current score
3. Create detection codes for:
   1. Collision with food
   2. Collision with walls
   3. Collision with tail
