# Day 4 Randomisation and Lists

## Overview

Day 4 starts with using the `randint()` function and lists to determine the outcome of a program to the basics of lists.

    Exercise 4.1 - Using randint() to get 0 or 1 for heads or tails
    Exercise 4.2 - Using randint() to get an element at an index of a list
    Exercise 4.3 - Working with lists and nested lists to call indexes and update

## Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Using what was learned from the exercises, the project for Day 4 was to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game app. This game would randomly select an outcome for the computer after a user makes their choice for Rock, Paper, or Scissors. With conditional statements, the game would determine the winner based on the gameplay rules.

### Instructions

1. Create a program that allows you to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. When you input the selection, the program will randomly select a choice as well.
3. The game compares each choice and determines the winner based on the official rules.

        Rock beats Scissors
        Scissors beats Paper
        Paper beats Rock
