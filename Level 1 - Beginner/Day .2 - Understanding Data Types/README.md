# Day 2 Understanding Data Types

## Overview

Day 2 starts with the different data types along and extends previous learning.

    Exercise 2.1 - Working with data types
    Exercise 2.2 - Develop a BMI Calculator
    Exercise 2.3 - Develop a countdown

## Project: Tip Calculator

Using what was learned from the exercises, the project for Day 3 was to build a Tip Calculator. This program would ask a user to input bill amount, percent amount, and a split count to calculate total amount each person should pay.

### Instructions

Calculate the bill split after tip between the number of people paying the bill.

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip:

- Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
- Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

**Tip:** There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.
