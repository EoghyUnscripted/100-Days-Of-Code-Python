# Day 6 Functions & Karel

## Overview

Day 6 starts with developing new functions to perform repeated codes. These codes are then used with Karel to test using visuals.

    Exercise 6.1 - Create a jump() function to move the Karel robot over a set number of walls
    Exercise 6.2 - Modify code to test if the Karel robot lands on a randomly placed flag
    Exercise 6.3 - Modify code to move the Karel robot over a random amount of walls
    Exercise 6.4 - Update the code with additional functions to move the Karel robot over random amount of walls and heights

## Project: Escape the Maze

Using what was learned from the exercises, the project for Day 6 was to build a final code using functions to dynamically move the Karel robot around a maze. To do this, the code must detect the placements of walls and blockages to determine how to move the robot to navigate. The robot should end at the exit of the maze where a flag is placed.

### Instructions

Testing Website: [Reeborg World - Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)

A robot located at (x, y) = (1, 1) carries no object.
This challenge will randomize the starting position of the robot.
**GOAL:** Move the robot along the maze path to the final position of (6,4)
