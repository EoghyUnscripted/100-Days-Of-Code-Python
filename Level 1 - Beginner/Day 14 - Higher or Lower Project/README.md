# Day 14 Higher or Lower

## Project: Higher or Lower Game

Using what we learned in previous lectures, the goal of this project was to use that knowledge alone to build a basic Blackjack game. This game would include using functions, parameters, returns, variables, loops, conditional operators, lists, and other built-in functions. The game would deal the user 2 cards, and the user can choose to accept more cards, or end the game. Once the game ends, the total scores would be added and a winner declared.
