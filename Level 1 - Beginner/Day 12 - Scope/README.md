# Day 12 Scope

## Overview

For Day 12, we learned about local, global and block scopes for variables and how to use and access them.

## Project: Guess The Number

For the project, we will be building a number guessing game. This game will allow users to choose a level and guess a number with a set amount of lives. Using all the knowledge we have learned so far in this course, including loops, lists, functions, etc, we will build the game from scratch.

### Instructions

This final project is also a solo run which does not include source code or hints. Below are the listed requirements for the final game and it is up to us to build the program from scratch.

#### Requirements

1. Include an ASCII art logo
2. Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100
3. Check user's guess against actual answer
   1. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer
   2. If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player
4. Track the number of turns remaining
   1. If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player
5. Include two different difficulty levels (e.g., 10 guesses in easy mode, only 5 guesses in hard mode)
