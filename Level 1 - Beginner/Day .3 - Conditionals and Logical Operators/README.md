# Day 3 Conditionals and Logical Operators

## Overview

Day 3 starts with using conditional statements and logical operators to determine the flow of the program.

    Exercise 3.1 - Using logical operators to test odd and even numbers
    Exercise 3.2 - Enhance the BMI Calculator to include conditional statements
    Exercise 3.3 - Check if an input year is a Leap Year

## Project: Treasure Island

Using what was learned from the exercises, the project for Day 2 was to build a Treasure Island app. This program would give users storylines and options to choose from. Choosing right will move the story forward. If wrong, it ends. Based on the "choose your own ending" books.

### Instructions

1. Create a storyline for your treasure hunt adventure
2. Using if loops, ask for users to make choices for the story along the way
3. With each choice, the user will progress until they find the treasure, or choose wrong and the program ends
